# D3 Homework - Data Journalism and D3

### Core Assignment: D3 Dabbler 
Created a scatter plot between`Healthcare vs. Poverty`.

Used D3 techniques to create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. Pulled in the data from `data.csv` by using the `d3.csv` function.

* State abbreviations are included in the circles.
* Situated axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.
*Used `python -m http.server` to run the visualization. The page is hosted at `localhost:8000` in your web browser.

### Bonus: Impress the Boss 
Incorporate d3-tip:
Added tooltips to the circles which display each tooltip with the data that the user has selected. Used the `d3-tip.js` plugin developed by [Justin Palmer](https://github.com/Caged).
